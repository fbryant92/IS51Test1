The program is trying to determine which paymen option is better (more money).
First option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. The secon doption is 1 dollars  a day with it being doubled each day for 10 days.
There will be two functions to calculate the pay rate.
function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function 2 will calulate the amount for the second

function1 will output 100 * 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times, with each time, doubling the amount and add the amount to the total.

if the amount is equal, we output to the user "Option 1 and option 2 are the same"
if the option 1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if the option 2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
